# KMeans
# Project Title:
Analysis and Prediction of "Mall_Customers.csv" of Americian mall market called as phonix mall to find out how many customers are visited to a particular shop. On the basis of this prediction of annual income verses spending scores
# Disclaimer:
In this particular dataset e assume Annual income as centroid spending score from the range 1-100 called as datanodes of the cluster
# Porblem Statement:
The American market as per the GDP of 2011 'phonix_trillums' mall in a first range out of 5.The owner wants to be exact which particular shop or products search in differnt kind of clusters a entire mall
As a datascience predict the futurist finaincial market GDP rate based on no.of clusters
The client wants atleast top 5 clusters[shops].

# Conclusion:
According to the model basic prediction using machine learning algorithm KMeans clustering we found that cluster 1 which consists red color is the highest cluster which attach more than 50 data nodes.
